# Ethical Considerations
It is not a secure way of checking and encrypting a password due to it's simplicity It also shouldn't be used to decrypt more sophisticated encyptions, this is morally wrong as it can potentially hurt the livelyhood for someone else. Not only that, you don't learn from quick and easy
